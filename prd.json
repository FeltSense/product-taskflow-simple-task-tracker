  "executiveSummary": {
    "problemStatement": "Many individuals and small teams struggle with keeping track of their daily tasks and priorities, often relying on scattered notes or overly complex project management tools. Current solutions are either too basic (like simple to-do lists) or too complex (like enterprise project management software), leaving users without an intuitive middle ground that balances simplicity with essential productivity features.",
    "targetUsers": "Individual professionals, freelancers, students, and small team members (2-5 people) who need a straightforward way to organize and track their personal or collaborative tasks without the complexity of enterprise-level project management tools. Primary users are tech-comfortable individuals aged 22-45 who value clean interfaces and efficient workflows.",
    "valueProposition": "TaskFlow provides the perfect balance between simplicity and functionality, offering an intuitive task management experience that helps users stay organized without overwhelming them with unnecessary features or complex interfaces.",
    "missionStatement": "To help individuals and small teams achieve their goals through simple, effective task organization and tracking."
