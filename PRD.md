## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Many individuals and small teams struggle with keeping track of their daily tasks and priorities, often relying on scattered notes or overly complex project management tools. Current solutions are either too basic (like simple to-do lists) or too complex (like enterprise project management software), leaving users without an intuitive middle ground that balances simplicity with essential productivity features.

### Target Users
Individual professionals, freelancers, students, and small team members (2-5 people) who need a straightforward way to organize and track their personal or collaborative tasks without the complexity of enterprise-level project management tools. Primary users are tech-comfortable individuals aged 22-45 who value clean interfaces and efficient workflows.

### Value Proposition
TaskFlow provides the perfect balance between simplicity and functionality, offering an intuitive task management experience that helps users stay organized without overwhelming them with unnecessary features or complex interfaces.

### Mission
> To help individuals and small teams achieve their goals through simple, effective task organization and tracking.

## Core Features

### F001: Task Creation and Management
**Priority**: must-have

Users can create tasks with essential details including title, description, due date, and priority level. This is the core functionality that enables users to capture and organize their work items. Tasks can be edited at any time and deleted when no longer needed. The interface emphasizes quick task entry to minimize friction in capturing thoughts and commitments.

*As a user, I want to quickly create and manage tasks with relevant details so that I can capture all my work items in one place and keep track of what needs to be done.*

### F002: Task Organization with Lists/Categories
**Priority**: must-have

Users can create custom lists or categories to organize their tasks logically, such as 'Work', 'Personal', 'Shopping', etc. This feature helps users separate different areas of their life and maintain better focus. Lists can be created, renamed, and deleted, with tasks easily moved between lists. The system provides a default 'General' list for uncategorized tasks.

*As a user, I want to organize my tasks into different lists or categories so that I can separate work from personal tasks and focus on specific areas of my life.*

### F003: Task Status and Completion Tracking
**Priority**: must-have

Users can mark tasks as complete with a simple checkbox interaction, and completed tasks are visually distinguished (crossed out, grayed out). The system maintains a history of completed tasks that users can review for motivation and reference. Users can also mark tasks as incomplete if needed. A progress indicator shows completion percentage for each list.

*As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete and see my progress so that I feel accomplished and can track what I've achieved over time.*

### F004: Priority Levels and Visual Indicators
**Priority**: should-have

Tasks can be assigned priority levels (High, Medium, Low) with distinct visual indicators such as colored tags or icons. High-priority tasks are prominently displayed and can be sorted to the top of lists. This feature helps users focus on what matters most and makes important deadlines visible at a glance. Priority can be changed at any time.

*As a user, I want to set priority levels for my tasks so that I can focus on the most important items first and never miss critical deadlines.*

### F005: Search and Filter Functionality
**Priority**: should-have

Users can search tasks by title and description using a search bar, and filter tasks by various criteria including status (complete/incomplete), priority level, due date range, and list/category. Search results are highlighted and filters can be combined. This feature becomes essential as users accumulate more tasks and need to quickly find specific items.

*As a user, I want to search and filter my tasks so that I can quickly find specific tasks or focus on particular types of work without scrolling through everything.*

### F006: Due Date Management and Reminders
**Priority**: should-have

Users can set due dates for tasks with a date picker interface. Tasks approaching their due dates are highlighted with visual indicators (different colors for overdue, due today, due this week). The dashboard shows an overview of upcoming deadlines. While email notifications are not in MVP scope, visual indicators provide adequate reminder functionality.

*As a user, I want to set due dates for my tasks and see upcoming deadlines so that I never miss important commitments and can plan my work effectively.*

## MVP Scope
The MVP will focus on core task management functionality including creating, organizing, and tracking tasks with essential features like categories, priorities, due dates, and search/filter capabilities. The emphasis is on providing a clean, intuitive interface that works well across devices without overwhelming users with advanced features. User accounts and data persistence are included, but advanced collaboration, integrations, and notification systems are excluded from the initial release.
