## Core Features

### F001: Task Creation and Management
**Priority**: must-have

Users can create new tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and priority levels. Tasks can be edited, updated, and deleted as needed. This is the foundational feature that allows users to capture and manage their to-do items in a structured way. The interface should be quick and intuitive, allowing rapid task entry without unnecessary friction.

*As a user, I want to quickly create and manage tasks with relevant details so that I can capture all my to-dos in one organized place*

### F002: Task Status and Completion
**Priority**: must-have

Users can mark tasks as complete, pending, or in-progress with visual indicators for each status. Completed tasks can be viewed separately or hidden from the main view. This feature provides users with a sense of accomplishment and helps them track their progress. The status changes should be immediate and satisfying to encourage continued use.

*As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete and track my progress so that I can see my accomplishments and stay motivated*

### F003: Task Categorization and Labels
**Priority**: must-have

Users can organize tasks using custom categories or labels such as 'Work', 'Personal', 'Shopping', etc. Categories can be color-coded for visual organization. Users can filter and view tasks by category, making it easier to focus on specific areas of their life or work. This feature helps users maintain better organization and context switching.

### F004: Due Date Management and Reminders
**Priority**: should-have

Users can set due dates for tasks and receive visual indicators for overdue, due today, and upcoming tasks. The system provides clear visual hierarchy showing which tasks need immediate attention. Due dates help users prioritize their work and manage deadlines effectively. The interface should make it easy to spot urgent tasks at a glance.

### F005: Task Search and Filtering
**Priority**: should-have

Users can search for tasks by title, description, or category, and apply filters to view specific subsets of tasks (completed, pending, by category, by due date). This feature becomes essential as users accumulate more tasks over time. The search should be fast and intuitive, helping users quickly locate specific tasks or groups of related tasks.

*As a user, I want to search and filter my tasks so that I can quickly find specific tasks or focus on particular groups of work*

### F006: Simple Dashboard and Analytics
**Priority**: nice-to-have

Users see a clean dashboard showing task completion statistics, upcoming deadlines, and a summary of their productivity. Basic metrics include tasks completed today/this week, completion rate, and overdue task count. This feature provides users with insights into their productivity patterns and helps them understand their progress over time without overwhelming complexity.

## MVP Scope
The MVP will focus on core task management functionality including creating, editing, and completing tasks with basic organization through categories and due dates. Users will have a simple, clean interface for managing their daily tasks with essential filtering and search capabilities. Advanced features like team collaboration, integrations, and detailed analytics will be excluded from the initial release to maintain simplicity and speed to market.
