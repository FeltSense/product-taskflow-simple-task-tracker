## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Individuals and small teams struggle to organize and track their daily tasks effectively, often losing track of priorities and deadlines. Existing solutions are either too complex with unnecessary features or too basic to provide meaningful productivity insights.

### Target Users
Individual professionals, freelancers, students, and small team members (2-5 people) who need a straightforward way to manage personal and collaborative tasks without overwhelming complexity or enterprise-level features.

### Value Proposition
A clean, intuitive task tracker that focuses on essential task management features with just enough collaboration capabilities to be useful for small teams, without the bloat of complex project management tools.

### Mission
> To provide the simplest yet effective task tracking experience that helps users stay organized and productive without getting lost in feature complexity.

## Core Features

### F001: Task Management
**Priority**: must-have

Users can create, edit, and delete tasks with essential information including title, description, due date, and priority level. This is the core functionality that allows users to capture and manage their to-do items. Tasks can be marked as complete or incomplete, providing a sense of progress and accomplishment. The interface should be clean and focused on quick task entry and updates.

*As a user, I want to create and manage tasks with basic details so that I can keep track of what needs to be done*

### F002: Task Status Tracking
**Priority**: must-have

Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete with visual indicators showing the current status. Completed tasks should be visually distinguished from active tasks while remaining accessible for reference. The system should track completion timestamps for basic progress insights. This feature provides the satisfying experience of checking off completed work.

*As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete so that I can track my progress and feel accomplished*

### F003: Task Prioritization
**Priority**: must-have

Users can assign priority levels (High, Medium, Low) to tasks with visual indicators like colors or icons. High-priority tasks should be prominently displayed to help users focus on what matters most. The system should allow easy priority changes as circumstances evolve. This feature helps users make better decisions about task ordering and focus.

*As a user, I want to set task priorities so that I can focus on the most important work first*

### F004: Due Date Management
**Priority**: must-have

Users can set due dates for tasks with calendar picker interface and visual indicators for upcoming or overdue items. The system should highlight overdue tasks prominently and show approaching deadlines. Due dates should be optional but when set, they provide crucial context for task prioritization. Clear visual cues help users manage time-sensitive work effectively.

*As a user, I want to set due dates on tasks so that I can manage time-sensitive work and avoid missing deadlines*

### F005: Task Organization
**Priority**: should-have

Users can create custom categories or lists to organize tasks by project, context, or any personal system. Tasks can be moved between categories easily through drag-and-drop or menu selection. Each category should be clearly labeled and collapsible for better screen real estate management. This feature enables users to group related tasks and reduce mental load.

*As a user, I want to organize tasks into categories so that I can group related work and find tasks more easily*

### F006: User Authentication
**Priority**: must-have

Simple user registration and login system that allows users to securely access their personal task data across sessions and devices. The system should include password reset functionality and basic security measures. User data should be private and accessible only to the account owner. This feature enables persistent task storage and future collaboration features.

*As a user, I want to create an account and log in so that my tasks are saved and accessible only to me*

## MVP Scope
The MVP will focus on individual task management with essential features for creating, organizing, prioritizing, and tracking tasks. Users will have personal accounts to securely store their data. The scope deliberately excludes team collaboration, advanced reporting, and mobile apps to maintain simplicity and enable rapid validation of core task management value.
