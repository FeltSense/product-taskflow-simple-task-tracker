## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Individuals and small teams struggle to organize and track their tasks effectively, often relying on scattered notes, complex project management tools, or memory alone. This leads to missed deadlines, forgotten tasks, and decreased productivity due to lack of a simple, focused task management solution.

### Target Users
Individual professionals, freelancers, students, and small team members who need a straightforward way to create, organize, and track personal or shared tasks without the complexity of enterprise project management tools.

### Value Proposition
A clean, intuitive task tracker that focuses on simplicity and ease of use, allowing users to quickly capture, organize, and complete tasks without overwhelming features or steep learning curves.

### Mission
> To provide the simplest yet effective way for individuals and small teams to stay organized and productive through focused task management.

## Core Features

### F001: Task Creation and Management
**Priority**: must-have

Users can create new tasks with titles, descriptions, and due dates. Tasks can be edited at any time and deleted when no longer needed. This core functionality provides the foundation for all task tracking activities and ensures users can capture and modify their work items efficiently.

*As a user, I want to create and manage tasks with relevant details so that I can keep track of what needs to be done*

### F002: Task Status Management
**Priority**: must-have

Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete with a simple checkbox interface. Completed tasks remain visible but are visually distinguished from active tasks. This feature provides the satisfying experience of checking off completed work while maintaining visibility of accomplishments.

*As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete so that I can track my progress and feel accomplished*

### F003: Task Organization with Categories
**Priority**: should-have

Users can create custom categories (like 'Work', 'Personal', 'Urgent') and assign tasks to these categories. Categories help organize tasks by type, priority, or project, making it easier to focus on specific areas of work. Users can filter their task view by category to reduce cognitive load.

*As a user, I want to organize my tasks into categories so that I can focus on specific types of work and maintain better organization*

### F004: Due Date Tracking
**Priority**: should-have

Users can assign optional due dates to tasks and receive visual indicators for upcoming and overdue items. The interface highlights tasks approaching their due dates and clearly marks overdue tasks to help users prioritize their work effectively and meet deadlines.

*As a user, I want to set due dates for tasks so that I can prioritize urgent work and avoid missing deadlines*

### F005: User Authentication and Data Persistence
**Priority**: must-have

Users can create accounts, log in securely, and have their tasks saved permanently to the cloud. This ensures tasks are never lost and can be accessed from any device. The authentication system protects user data while providing a seamless experience across sessions.

*As a user, I want to create an account and log in so that my tasks are saved securely and accessible from anywhere*

### F006: Search and Filter Functionality
**Priority**: nice-to-have

Users can search for tasks by title or description text and apply filters to show only active tasks, completed tasks, or tasks from specific categories. This helps users quickly find specific tasks in larger lists and focus on relevant subsets of their work.

*As a user, I want to search and filter my tasks so that I can quickly find specific items in large task lists*

## MVP Scope
The MVP will focus on core task management capabilities including creating, editing, and deleting tasks with basic status tracking (complete/incomplete). Users will have secure authentication and persistent data storage. Essential organization features like categories and due dates will be included to provide meaningful task prioritization. Search and advanced filtering will be deferred to post-MVP releases to maintain simplicity and faster time-to-market.
